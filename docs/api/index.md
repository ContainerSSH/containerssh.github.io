title: About the API
---

ContainerSSH itself does not have an API apart from exposing the [metrics](../advanced/metrics.md). However, it requires two external APIs: the [authentication server](../getting-started/authserver.md) for user authentication and the [config server](../getting-started/configserver.md) for supplying a user-specific container configuration.

We are providing an OpenAPI document for both.
