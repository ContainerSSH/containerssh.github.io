title: ContainerSSH release process

# ContainerSSH release process

In ContainerSSH we have two components that are in need of regular releases: libraries and binaries.

<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p>Most of our <a href="https://github.com/ContainerSSH/">libraries</a> are intended for internal consumption, but some are for external consumption. The release process is the same.</p>

<h2>Binaries</h2>
<p>Binaries are consumed by our users. Therefore, this release process is more involved to ensure quality.</p>
