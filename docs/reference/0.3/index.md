<h1>ContainerSSH Reference Manual</h1>

The Reference Manual provides reference material for ContainerSSH 0.3 and is oriented towards system operators wishing to use ContainerSSH on their system.

## Introduction

This manual contains documentation on how to set up, configure, monitor, and secure the ContainerSSH installation.

## Changes since ContainerSSH 0.2

This release adds the new [metrics service](metrics.md) which exposes several key metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format. It also adds [configurable logging](logging.md) and an option to disable command execution in the [DockerRun](dockerrun.md) and [KubeRun](kuberun.md) backends.
