| `DOCKER_GUEST_AGENT_DISABLED` | The [ContainerSSH Guest Agent](https://github.com/containerssh/agent) has been disabled, which is strongly discouraged. ContainerSSH requires the guest agent to be installed in the container image to facilitate all SSH features. Disabling the guest agent will result in breaking the expectations a user has towards an SSH server. We provide the ability to disable guest agent support only for cases where the guest agent binary cannot be installed in the image at all. |
| `DOCKER_IMAGE_LISTING` | The ContainerSSH Docker module is listing the locally present container images to determine if the specified container image needs to be pulled. |
| `DOCKER_IMAGE_LISTING_FAILED` | The ContainerSSH Docker module failed to list the images present in the local Docker daemon. This is used to determine if the image needs to be pulled.

| `DOCKER_IMAGE_PULL` | The ContainerSSH Docker module is pulling the container image. |
| `DOCKER_IMAGE_PULL_FAILED` | The ContainerSSH Docker module failed to pull the specified container image. This can be because of connection issues to the Docker daemon, or because the Docker daemon itself can't pull the image. If you don't intend to have the image pulled you should set the `ImagePullPolicy` to `Never`. See the [Docker documentation](https://containerssh.io/reference/docker) for details. |
| `DOCKER_IMAGE_PULL_NEEDED_CHECKING` | The ContainerSSH Docker module is checking if an image pull is needed. |
| `DOCKER_PROGRAM_ALREADY_RUNNING` | The ContainerSSH Docker module can't execute the request because the program is already running. This is a client error. |
| `DOCKER_SIGNAL_FAILED_NO_PID` | The ContainerSSH Docker module can't deliver a signal because no PID has been recorded. This is most likely because guest agent support is disabled. |
| `DOCKER_STREAM_INPUT_FAILED` | The ContainerSSH Docker module failed to stream stdin to the Docker engine. |
| `DOCKER_STREAM_OUTPUT_FAILED` | The ContainerSSH Docker module failed to stream stdout and stderr from the Docker engine. |
