<h1>Metrics</h1>

{{ reference_upcoming() }}

ContainerSSH contains a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)-compatible metrics server which can be enabled using the following configuration:

```yaml
metrics:
  <options here>
```

The metrics server has the following options:

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `enable` | `bool` | Enable metrics server. Defaults to false. |
| `path` | `string` | HTTP path to serve metrics on. Defaults to `/metrics`. |

Additionally, all options in the HTTP server section on the [HTTP and TLS](http.md#http-server-configuration) page are available. The metrics server defaults to port 9100.

!!! tip "Tip"
    For an example on configuring Prometheus with mutual TLS authentication see the [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#tls_config).

## Available metrics

You can configure Prometheus to grab the following metrics:

`containerssh_auth_server_failures`
: Number of failed requests to the authentication server since start.

`containerssh_auth_success`
: Number of successful authentications since start. Contains labels for `authtype` (`password` or `pubkey`) and `country` (see below).

`containerssh_auth_failures`
: Number of failed authentications since start. Contains labels for `authtype` (`password` or `pubkey`) and `country` (see below).

`containerssh_config_server_failures`
: Number of failed requests to the configuration server since start.

`containerssh_ssh_connections`
: Number of SSH connections since start. Contains a label for `country` (see below).

`containerssh_ssh_handshake_successful`
: Number of successful SSH handshakes since start. Contains a label for `country` (see below).

`containerssh_ssh_handshake_failed`
: Number of failed SSH handshakes since start. Contains a label for `country` (see below).

`containerssh_ssh_current_connections`
: Number of currently open SSH connections. Contains a label for `country` (see below).

## Country identification

Country identification works using [GeoIP2 or GeoLite2 from MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-services-and-databases). This database needs to be provided to ContainerSSH externally due to licensing concerns.

The default path for the GeoIP database is `/var/lib/GeoIP/GeoIP2-Country.mmdb`, but you can change that using the following configuration snippet:

```yaml
geoip:
  provider: "maxmind"
  maxmind-geoip2-file: '/var/lib/GeoIP/GeoIP2-Country.mmdb'
```
